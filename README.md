# Standard Version

Having problems? want to contribute?

Automate versioning and CHANGELOG generation, with semver and conventional commit messages.

## Installation

### As `npm run` script

Install and add to `devDependencies`:

```
npm i --save-dev standard-version
```

Add an [`npm run` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) to your _package.json_:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version"
  }
}
```

Now you can use `npm run release` in place of `npm version`.

This has the benefit of making your repo/package more portable, so that other developers can cut releases without having to globally install `standard-version` on their machine.

### As global bin

Install globally (add to your `PATH`):

```
npm i -g standard-version
```

Now you can use `standard-version` in place of `npm version`.

This has the benefit of allowing you to use `standard-version` on any repo/package without adding a dev dependency to each one.
